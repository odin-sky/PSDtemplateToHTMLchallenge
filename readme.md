# PSD to HTML Challenge
Getting a free PSD template online and converting a PSD file to HTML and making it responsive.
The PSD template is known as Taintlessness

## Experience
Need to be accurate with pixels and also making the webpage responsive is challenging.
Used bootstrap for easier layouting and Photoshop for color hexes, counting margins, logos and backgrounds.

## Problems
The font used is not free/available so I had to use another one so the spacing is off compared to the original.

Hard to adjust everything according to the size of mobile/tablet.

Still not familiar with jQuery.

## Todos
Have to read more about hamburgers and making the page responsive but for now this challenge is complete.

Read more on jQuery as well.
