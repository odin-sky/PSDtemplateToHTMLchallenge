# PSD to HTML
Getting a free PSD template online and converting a PSD file to HTML and making it responsive.
The PSD template is known as Taintlessness

## Experience
Need to be accurate with pixels and also making the webpage responsive is challenging.

## Problems
The font used is not free/available so I had to use another one so the spacing is off compared to the original.

## Todos
Still not finished, should Make it responsive. Will update soon.
